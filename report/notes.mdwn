## Using OpenGL 3+ on different hardwares

One of the biggest difficulties we encountered was to make the program work on
different graphic cards. Luckily enough, the two laptops we work on have deffierent
hardware (one nvidia and one ATI) so it gives stronger chances to detect some problems. 
For instance, at some point the program worked on both computers, but after an update
of the graphics driver the nvidia one wouldn't render the scene any more, displaying
silently a black screen instead. It turned out that some initialization steps were
done in the wrong order (some code that was written a week before without us noticing it),
with ATI drivers being more permissive than nvida's on
the matter. The use of gDebugger helped a lot to understand what was going on inside,
since a traditionnal debugguer cannot inspect what happens within OpenGL and since OpenGL
does not give much information on errors.
gDebugger let you see and intercept draw calls and displays the buffers that are
on gpu memory (textures, render buffers, vertex buffers, etc.), which is convenient
when implementing deferred shading.
It also happened that in order to implement the deferred shading on the nvidia linux
system, we had to enable the _glewExperimental_ flag.


## Ray marching algorithm

Ray marching is a technic similar to ray tracing on many aspects. The color of
each fragment is determined by using rays going from the viewer to the scene with
a pinhole camera model. Rays are not casted directly to the surfaces of the objects
like in most of the methods derived from ray tracing. Instead, the distance to the
closest object is computed, the ray is advanced one step, and this is repeated
until the ray reaches an object, or a maximum number of steps is reached.

This method can seem sub-optimal at first, as every ray need several iterations before reaching an object,
but it turns out that it is often faster
than raytracing for the following reasons:
 * most simple objects have a very fast distance equation as we can see at this
 [link](http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm).
 * distance functions can be modified in order to add interesting effects such as
infinite repetition for a negligible cost.


### Infinite repetition 

In raymarching repeating objects infinitely is both easy and cheap in term of gpu cycles.

Lets take a look at the distance function of a sphere.

#define center vec3(0,0,0)
#define radius 2.0
float SphereDistance( vec3 point )
{
    return length( center - point ) - radius;
}

This functions returns the distance between a point and the center of the sphere
minus the radius of the sphere.

To repeat infinitely the sphere arround the X axis we only need to add a modulo
operation like follows:

#define dist 10
// ...
point.x = mod( point.x + dist/2, dist ) - dist/2;
return length( center - point ) - radius;
}

An infinty of copy of the same object appear now, and the frame rate did not change
noticeably. adding _dist/2_ inside the modulo and removing it afterward doesn't alter
the position of the object, but is necessary because without it, the sphere would
be cut by the modulo as it is centered on zero.

%todo: image of a cut sphere

%todo: scheme to explain the effect of modulo on the position of the distance field

We can now see a big advantage of ray marching. repeating geometry to infinity
at almost no cost is great. However, the resulting image is somewhat boring because
of the repetition itself. This is not a big problem however, because we can modify
the distance function in order to have modify the shape in function of the position.
For instance, to have variable sphere radius on the same object wa can add the following
line before applying the modulo:

float newRadius =  1+2*sin(floor(point.x/dist)));

Here, _floor(point.x/dist)_ returns a different constant number for replication
of the sphere as we devide by the distance between two repetitions, and remove
the floating point part of the number. This number would grow along with x, so it
can be interesting to place it inside a periodic function so as to make it stay
whithin a certain range. Then is is just a matter of playing with the mathematical
function in order to break periodicity and introduce a feeling of randomness.

too sum up, with the following distance function, we obtain an infinite number
of spheres which radius varies between 1.0 and 3.0. 

#define dist 10
#define center vec3(0,0,0)
float SphereDistance( vec3 point )
{
    float newRadius =  1+2*sin(floor(point.x/dist)));
    point.x = mod( point.x + dist/2, dist ) - dist/2;
    return length( center - point ) - newRadius;
}

Performance-wise, this is huge. An infinity of objects in the screen introduced by
one simple three lines distance function that contains no loop, and not even a branch.  


### Computing normals

At first we tried to compute normals using a specific function for each kind of
shape. This is simple for a sphere but can get less convenient for other objects.
In fact there is a much simpler and efficient way to compute normals, by using
the expression of the gradient:
Given a point _p_ on the surface of an object
described by the distance function _f_, its normal _n_ can be evaluated using a very
small _epsilon_ quantity as follows:

n = normalize( vec3(
      f(p + vec3(epsilon,0,0)  ) - f(p - vec3(epsilon,0,0))
    , f(p + vec3(0,epsilon,0)  ) - f(p - vec3(0,epsilon,0))
    , f(p + vec3(0,0,epsilon)  ) - f(p - vec3(0,0,epsilon))
) );

This is very convenient on objects more complicated than a sphere, most objects that is.

### Ambient occlusion

Ambient occlusion (AO) is the effect of small areas being darkened by taking into
account the attenuation of light due to occlusion by surrounding objects.
AO is a crude approximateion of the way light bounces around in real world, in
order to provide with more realistic results. It does not give as good results as
global illumination techniques like radiosity, but helps providing convincing graphics
in real time.
